Todo List:

Change all colors in Colors.java to their corresponding rgb values.
Make the colors into macros?
Run.java line 188..?: Replace w/ regexes.
Opening draw pile causes crash
List all utilized features in the README
Check whether or not statuses used to show in the order they were obtained.
Figure out how the sts stat ordering works.
Add headers to the files.
Make it so the robber(s) don't "drop gold" when they run away.
Continue writing docs (continue from Entity.java.)
Make Jaw Worm art wider?
Try to make the screen width/etc. update in real time by not using Run.SCREENX & using SettingsManager.x instead?
In the statuses list (& possibly any other lists, too), change the section headers to be some different color (besides just white)
Is there benefit to having a screen/interface class?
OnTurnEnd shouldn't be called when you win the combat.
From getImageWStatuses: "Enemy images are displaying weirdly; louses have 3 spaces on the left & 5 on the right, while blue slaver is 1 & 0 respectively."
Add more assertions?
Search the directory for other instances of "todo".
Add a symbol for gold in the combat rewards.
Potions, relics, etc.

Stretch Goals:
Allow for a screen width of 155
Color changing energy cost based on if it is above or below base cost
Put something in to make newly drawn card pop out (ie white instead of gray or smth?) so it's easier to read?
Replace all text that appears below the screen with popups?
Make "Select card from disc." (e.g.) show the card images and not just the text.
