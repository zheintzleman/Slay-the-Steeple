Recreating Slay the Spire in the Terminal using 100% Java.
Intended for the VSCode Terminal with the settings included in the vscode/settings.json
Created by Zachary Heintzleman. Originally an AP Computer Science A final project, which I have
since expanded on. All code written completely by myself -- no AI or copy-pasting code from Stack
Overflow without knowing what it does. Pixel art made by me, based on the real Slay the Spire art.
Large text the only thing not made by me (see App.java).

Utilizes all of the AP Java features (Polymorphism, Exception Handling, General OOP Concepts,
etc.), along with more advanced features such as the Java Collection framework, Streams, File IO,
and Javadoc Comments.
