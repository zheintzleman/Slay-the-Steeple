Recreating Slay the Spire in the Terminal using entire Java.
Intended for the VSCode Terminal with the settings included in vscode/settings.json
Created by Zachary Heintzleman. Originally an AP Computer Science A final project, which I have
since expanded on. All code written completely by myself -- no AI or copy-pasting code from Stack
Overflow without knowing what it does. Not currently using any libraries, either (excluding the base java package) -- all display methods, ANSI escape sequences, file IO, etc. done by me for practice purposes. Pixel art made by me as well, based directly on the real Slay the Spire art.
(Large text on intro and death screens the only thing not made by me -- see App.java.)

Utilizes all of the AP Java topics (Polymorphism, Exception Handling,
etc.), along with more advanced features such as the Java Collection framework, Streams, File IO,
and Javadoc Comments.
